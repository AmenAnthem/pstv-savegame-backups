# PSTV save game backups

## Usage
To transfer save game files between a PSTV and PC use the [Content Manager Assistent](http://cma.dl.playstation.net/cma/win/gb/index.html).

To convert a PlayStation 1 save game contained in a memory card file you can first use [MemcardRex](https://github.com/ShendoXT/memcardrex) to extract the save game to its own file (resulting in a MCS file) and then convert this file to a PSTV save game file (resulting in a VMP file) using [web save editor](https://web.save-editor.com/tool/wse_ps1_save_converter.html).
